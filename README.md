# What you sense is what you feel, what you feel is what you believe. There is no strict emotional responces, there would be a reflection of ours.

## What is the heart of SW Development?
------
This will  divided into Two sections.
### Technical interpretation
Safe, and Fast. Show me the code, and your analysis before you talk.
### Cultural interpretation
 This is based on MY cultural basis. The only thing we can strictly split into, is Yin/Yang(0 and 1). The world we perceive, is the world we simulated. So we should classify things, at 2x2 groups: { (Cohesive, Fluent) , (True, False) }. When things tends to lose their stability, you should find their tendency to fix them.
## Developer's Profile
 From Daegu, South Korea. Confucianist from Yeongnam Province. Network congestiion control is my strength. I was Cloud Computing, and Wired Network engineer at CPS research from ETRI, Daejeon.
 
 ## Notice
 People, who declare me as a fool, are seeing their foolish part, from mirror named YUNJIN. So don't be rude. Or I would crash your boundaries as an amount of what I've lost. So don't be a teacher of others. I am also aware of my neighborhoods, so don't be rude on your friends.
 ### Warning
 I have Autism Spectrum Disorder, but I will use this as a metric to analyze people. People who see me as a broken machine tends to be more rude(maybe they lost their humanity). So please treat me as a mere human, not as a failed research of my parents.
 So reverse-think before you tank.
 # Who would be my people
People who know about the eternal origin of this world.
# Power of Soul
Without ruler, it still rules the nation.
:)
